# Estimating Software is Hard ⏱

## Prioritisation

Estimating can help us to have a rough idea about how long it can take to finish
a story. We can use this metric to prioritise stories.


Sort estimated stories:

```
           │             │              
           │  Important  │ Unimportant  
───────────┼─────────────┼──────────────
           │             │              
           │             │              
    Urgent │             │              
           │             │              
           │             │              
           │             │              
───────────┼─────────────┼──────────────
           │             │              
           │             │              
  Unurgent │             │              
           │             │              
           │             │              
           │             │              
```

You can also use the Parito Law:
_The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few,
or the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for many events, roughly 80%
of the effects come from 20% of the causes_

## Estimation

_good estimation_ = precision + accurate

For example, between now and 10 years is not really a precise amount of time.
Next Friday at 10pm is precise but not accurate.

How to provide a good estimation?
You can break down your task/story in order to understand what you are really
estimating:

- Documentation
- Integration to the current system
- Localisation
- Legality
- Implementation of the code
- Exception management (recovery)
- Code review 🐛
- Unit test 🐛
- Integration test 🐛
- Manuel test 🐛
- e2e test 🐛
- Security
- Log Events
- Metrics
- Alarm
- Tracing
- Performance
- Package 📦
- Deployment 🚀
- User experience
- UI
- Accessibility
